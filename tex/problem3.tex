\section{Argon Molecular Dynamics}

We can now apply these statistical ideas to the results of your argon MD simulation. Run as
long a simulation as is practical and make measurements of the temperature, potential energy
and the time average of the virial, which is given by
%
\begin{equation}
    \sum_i \sum_{j > i} r_{ij} \frac{ \partial V_{ij} }{ \partial r_{ij} }
\end{equation}
%
every MD time step. You should be able to run a few thousand steps, after thermalization.
Measure the autocorrelation times for the temperature, potential energy and virial. Also
measure the covariance matrix for these \(3\) quantities. Use your estimate of the
autocorrelation times, along with binning and the jackknife method to give an error on the
pressure from your simulation.
